##Calculations Done:


1. Average Facilities per Student (AFPSi​): 


AFPSi​=Si​Fi​​


Where:
AFPSi​ is the Average Facilities per Student for state i,
Fi​ is the total facilities in state i,
Si​ is the total number of students in state i.


2. Maximum Possible Facilities (MPFi​): The determination of the maximum possible facilities is context-dependent. If you have a specific value denoted as the theoretical maximum facilities (TMFi​) for state i, then: 
MPFi​=TMFi​


3. F-Factor Calculation (FFi​): 


FFi​=​AFPSi​​/∑​Fi


Where:


FFi​ is the F-Factor for state i,
∑​Fi​ is the summation of total facilities across all states.
This F-Factor provides a normalized measure of the average facilities per student, taking into account the overall availability of facilities across all states. It offers a relative assessment, highlighting the proportional impact of facilities on literacy rates.


##Prediction of Literacy:


i = % increase in literacy = (CF*FF)%
Predicted Literacy% = literacy rate 2023 + i


The multiplication of these two factors give us the possible growth by doubling the benfit, which in turn if added to the originaly literacy rate can be a decent prediction. 


The F-Factor and C-Factor serve as key inputs, allowing us to establish correlations between facilities, creativity, and literacy rates. I derived this equation with the help of statistics and data modelling. These models aim to project future literacy rates based on the identified relationships and historical trends.
